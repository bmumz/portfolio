"Imposter syndrome" is a term every developer, and aspiring developer is familiar with. It's definitely not something that will just go away after you address it… it'll _unfortunately_ always be with you. It will creep up on you when you're least expecting, and try to consume you. The best thing to do to overcome it is actually just learning how to live with it.

<br/>

So what is imposter syndrome? Well, it comes from the term "imposter phenomenon", coined by psychologists Dr. Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne A. Imes in an article from 1978 called, "The Imposter Phenomenon in High Achieving Women: Dynamics and Therapeutic Intervention". Further research was done following the publication, and it was determined that this experience does occur across all demographics.

<br/>

To put it briefly, imposter syndrome is an internal experience that makes you believe you only got where you were out of chance, and **not** because you're good at what you do. People with imposter syndrome often think they're a fraud, and that they've "fooled" people to get to where they are.

<br/>

For me, and many others in the industry, it comes and goes. Most days, I believe in myself. I am proud of where I came from, and where I am going! Most days, I know that comparing myself (a completely self-taught developer), to a developer who's graduated from a bootcamp, or a developer who has a Computer Science degree, is the absolute worst thing I could do. But, some days- if I'm struggling with a difficult problem, or simply woke up on the wrong side of the bed… something might click in my brain to trigger imposter syndrome, and it feels like an uphill battle. Here are some things that have helped me learn to cope with these random bouts of imposter syndrome:

<br/>

## 1. Learn about yourself.

Identify why your mind is thinking these thoughts, and try to dig deeper into it. You will feel so much better if you get the hang of how to do this because, in the future, you will know how to stop it from totally consuming you.

<br/>

Something that really helped me with this step is a book called **The Mountain is You** by Brianna Wiest.

<br />

In the book, she explains there are many different habits and behaviors we might display that is indicative of self-sabotage. She explains what they are, and how to resolve, and be more mindful of them. For example, perfectionism, fear of failing, downplaying successes, and worrying about irrational fears and least likely circumstances are all things that could be the root of your imposter syndrome. The second you are able to identify these bad habits, you can work on them, and work on yourself.

> ### When we fail out of negligence, we take a step back. When we fail because we are attempting new feats, we take one step closer to what will work."— Brianna Wiest

<br/>

## 2. Practice mindfulness.

I know that "meditation" might be a strange concept for some, but hear me out! Before the pandemic hit, I would often go to a meditation studio. My favorite class was called "Visualize"- where you were encouraged to quiet your mind and create room for your desired intentions. It was part guided meditation, part manifestation. Practicing some concepts learned in the class has helped me immensely when battling imposter syndrome:

<br/>

### Self-care:

Tell yourself, _"I recognize this may bring up negative feelings. But I honor you, I'm proud of how far you've come, and I love you"_ however many times you need to throughout the day.

<br/>

### Gratitude:

Write down (or just simply recognize) what you are grateful for so far in your journey. What you are grateful for might not make sense to others. It might be something small, or something that sounds silly at first, but it is important not to completely discard the first thing that comes to mind. There is a reason your mind went there, and it could be the key to getting yourself out of the slump you're in!

<br/>

### Stepping Towards Your Goal:

Whatever you do, don't say "I can't do this". You can't do this _yet_, but you **will** do this! When you simply tell yourself "I can't do this," your brain will shut off. But if you say "_how_ can I do this?" your brain will surprise you and think of ideas to get you where you need to be. Try to jot down your ideas throughout the day, again, even if they seem silly!

<br/>

## 3. Break your problem up into pieces!

Something I like to do the day after I'm feeling consumed by imposter syndrome is prove myself wrong! If I found my imposter syndrome was triggered by a certain task, I try not to tackle that task right away, because that might lead to an endless loop…

<br/>

Instead, I start small- I map out my day starting with tasks I am already 100% comfortable with, to the things I need to brush up on (where I'm sure to read the documentation and/or search for blogs or videos about it)! Dissecting the challenge into smaller chunks helps immensely! That way, there are many little wins to be proud of, and the whole thing is less intimidating and "in-your-face".

<br/>

## 4. Join the tech community on Twitter, Discord, Slack etc.

This holds you accountable. If you start talking to fellow developers and joining challenges where you need to post your daily progress (like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100daysofcode&src=hashtag_click" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer">#100DaysOfCode!</a>), you are more likely to succeed. While I've only been a part of tech Twitter for a month, I'm quickly learning that the tech community is there to lift you up and help you get where you want to go! Help you solve challenges when you're blocked… not knock you down!
