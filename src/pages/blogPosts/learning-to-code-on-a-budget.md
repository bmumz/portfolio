First thing's first. I *can't* help you decide which language to start with. There are so many possible paths to take- web development, app development, data science, machine learning... This is definitely something you need to research and decide on your own!

In my case, I chose to start with frontend web development- HTML, CSS and JavaScript and React. From there, I learned Node.js/Express to dabble in the backend and create full stack applications.

Once you have a vague idea of the path you'll take... here's how you can achieve your goals!

## 1. Learn *how* you learn!

 It's important to note that each one of us has a different learning style. If we were all thrown textbooks and expected to learn programming that way, only a few of us would succeed! I find it's much easier to retain information when it's presented to me in *multiple ways*. For instance, combine any of the following:
- online courses (Udemy, Coursera, Edx)
- reading documentation, books, blog posts, etc.
- listening to audiobooks, podcasts
- watching YouTube videos.
  
In my case, I found it helpful to start learning on platforms such as [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) to get basic knowledge of CSS, HTML and JavaScript, and paired that with a more in depth Udemy course! This prepared me to 1. *learn* the basic concepts, and 2. *apply* those concepts in project form! All of these options also provide help when you're stuck, which can be good when you're starting out.

This approach worked well for me-  **in the beginning**. Now, I'm finding Udemy courses are too 'tutorial-y'. When I am learning something new, or practicing my current skills- I find it the most efficient to read documentation and build a project on my own to solidify my knowledge of the language/framework..

## 2. Create a roadmap...

Research Bootcamps or even college/university courses covering the path you are wanting to take. This will help you get a sense of what order you should be learning things. It is **really** important to give yourself time to grasp each concept before moving onto the next! You will only get lost if you try to skip the fundamentals at *any* step.

An example roadmap:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Basic UI Design (Responsiveness, Accessibility)
4. JavaScript
5. Data Structures and Algorithms
6. A JavaScript framework (React, Vue or Angular)
7. Node.js or another backend language

## 3. Hold yourself accountable.

Remember, if you're self-teaching- **you're** the only person capable of getting yourself to the next step. No one is there to hold your hand and guide you (well, unless you have a mentor, but you shouldn't put that on them!) You need to set *short* and *long* term goals for yourself, and be self-disciplined so you can achieve them.

For example,
**Short-term goal:** code for 1 hour a day.
**Long-term goal:** build a full-stack application.
**Longer-term goal:** get hired by awesome company!

## 4. Join the tech community!

Because you **will** get stuck! And will want/need help, or you'll feel like giving up. 

I highly recommend creating a Tech **Twitter** and **Instagram** account. You can participate in challenges like #100DaysOfCode on both platforms, follow like-minded developers to keep you motivated.


You can also look into Meetups in your area! Most have transitioned to online for now, but it's still helpful to get you out there in the tech community!

It's always important to note that just because someone has an online presence in the tech community, does **not** mean they're available to help you at any hour of the day! You should genuinely be trying to get to know people and help will come from there organically!

## 5. Remember... the learning will **never** stop!

...but that's why we got into tech... right?!
