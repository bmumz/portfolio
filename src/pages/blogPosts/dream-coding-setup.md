If 2020 taught me anything, it's the importance of creating the best out of what you have. Studying coding and doing freelance work at the counter-height kitchen table had been do-able, but was beginning to get uncomfortable for me after quite a few months. so I decided to create an office space in my bedroom. The space I had to work with was only 1m wide, which is smaller than 99% of the desks available on Ikea or Wayfair, so I chose to get creative. My father helped me out by sourcing a **live edge slab** back home- for significantly cheaper than they would've been here in Toronto.

<br />

## The Desk

Desktop: Walnut live edge.
Legs: black iron pipes.

Overall, the desk cost around **\$400**. But there's more than enough live edge leftover to make another project- I'm thinking a side table or maybe some shelves? To be determined...

<br/>

### Materials

- -live edge slab (walnut)
- -Polyx Oil - clear satin
- -black iron pipes
- -Minwax Paste Finishing Wax
- -Sandpaper (grits 60-180)

<br/>

### Step 1: Prepping the live edge...

<br/>

The first step was to decide which piece of the wood to use, cut it to size (square it if necessary. My piece was pretty square already, and I wanted to keep both live edges, so I skipped this), and fill any holes in with epoxy. Since my dad purchased the slab for me as a Christmas present, he took care of this step!

<br/>

The slab we chose didn't have any deep imperfections, which was great. A little 2 part epoxy did the trick to fill the holes in.

<br />

#### Sanding

After the slab was cut to size (40" W x 23" D), it was time to start sanding. The amount of sanding you have to do depends on which finish you choose. We chose to use Polyx Oil, which was a little pricier than a linseed oil or polyutherene finish, but...

<br/>

- -you only had to sand to 180 grit (as opposed to 400+)
- -no sanding between coats!
- -has a nice, natural looking finish, as opposed to a thick plasticy one.
- -isn't super smelly.

#### Finishing

After sanding, we wiped all the dust off with a dry cotton rag and cracked the Polyx Oil open. It is important to finish the live edge in a dry, relatively warm temperature. We did this in a car trailer with a heater.

<br/>

A little Polyx oil goes a long way! Rub it into the wood in figure-8 motions. I did this for about 15 minutes to ensure it was completely worked into the wood. Let dry for around 8 hours before applying the second coat. I did one side at a time to ensure proper drying.

<br />

### Step 2: Building the legs...

<br/>

Before lockdown, we were able to go into Home Depot and build out the legs in store to make sure we were getting the right pieces.

#### Things we took into accout:

- -height of desk: 30" tall total, so the legs should be around 28".
- -structural support in the depth and the width of the desk.
- -finishing the pipes so they wouldn't be greasy, and wouldn't rust.

#### Pieces used:

- -8 x floor flanges (4 for the floor, 4 to attach legs to desk)
- -2 x 12" pieces (for structural support in the depth)
- -2 x 18" pieces
- -1 x 24" (for structural support in the width)
- 4 x 3" pieces (for feet)
